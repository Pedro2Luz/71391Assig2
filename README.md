Before coding my project in Kotlin on Android Studio, I first designed it visually using a project mockup that I made on Figma. But when I tried to use the same colours from Figma in Android Studio, I 
ran into some problems. I tried several times to fix the problem, but I was unable to do so, and error 
messages continued to show. Errors were continuously displayed by Android Studio, suggesting that 
the photos were unacceptable.
I was so frustrated with the situation that I made the decision to try something new. Rather than 
sticking with the Figma colours, I chose colours at random and used them in my project. In addition, I 
had to import fresh images straight into Android Studio to replace the ones I had first imported from 
Figma because the imported images were also affecting.

This is a representation of the project mock-up and the way I see the finished app

1-Movie Selection: When a user opens the app, they are greeted with an eye-catching list of all the movies that are accessible. This makes it simple to browse and choose the stuff you want.  
  
2- Search Bar: By typing the titles of particular movies, users can locate them fast using a visible search bar. This function improves movie discovery efficiency and accessibility.
